MINNESOTA FISH

Minnesota Fish is a project that maps data ported from csv file to PostgreSQL DB onto Pyplot figures to visualize these
data.

PROJECT STATUS

This project is currently in development. Users can take a "tour" of fish that have been caught by the DNR from 1890 to
2015 by clicking the "tour" button in the GUI.

INSTALLATION AND SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

More on this forthcoming. I will build a smaller test DB with PostGres that runs fewer years and put it into the repo
along with instructions on how to set up the DB in PSQL on the users fs.


REFLECTION

This is a project that I am both designing and implementing as I go along to teach myself Postgres as well as a
language to utilize DB. This project is entirely self-directed as I have no official background in programming, but
I wish to build a portfolio of projects to launch a career in programming.

As a newbie programmer the biggest challenge I faced was setting up the environment and getting all of the appropriate
packages to run well together.
